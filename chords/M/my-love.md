# My Love
> Westlife

**Capo: 2

**Verse 1**:<br>
An empty street and empty house [G D]()<br>
A hole inside my heart [Bm Em]()<br>
I'm all alone the rooms are getting smaller [C D]()<br>

**Bridge**<br>
I wonder how I wonder why [G D]()<br>
I wonder where they are [Bm Em]()<br>
The days we had the song we sang together .. oh yeah [C A D]()<br>
And all my love I'm holding on for ever [C D G Em]()<br>
Reaching for the love that seem so far [Am C D]()<br>

**Chorus**:<br>
So I say a little prayer [C G]()<br>
And hope my dream will take me there [C G]()<br>
Where the skies are blue [C]()<br>
To see you once again my love [G Em7 A D]()<br>
Over seas from coast to coast [C G]()<br>
To find the place I love the most [C G]()<br>
Where the fields are green [C]()<br>
To see you once again my love [G Em7 A D G]()<br>

**Verse 2**:<br>
I try to read I go to work [G D]()<br>
I'm laughing with my friends [Bm Em]()<br>
But I can't stop to keep myself from thinking oh oh [C D]()<br>

**Bridge**<br>
**Chorus**<br>
