## Take me to your heart
> Michael Learns To Rock

**Capo: 1**   
   
[[D]]() Hiding form the rain and snow   
Trying to [[Bm]]() forget but I won't let go,   
[[G]]() Looking at a crowded street,   
[[A]]() Listening to my own heartbeat...   
   
[[Bm]]() So many [[F#m]]() people [[G]]() all [[A]]() around the [[D]]() world   
[[Bm]]() Tell me where do [[F#m]]() I find [[Em]]() someone like you [[A]]() girl...   
   
**Chorus:**   
Take me to your [[D]]() heart, take me to your [[Bm]]() soul,   
Give me your [[G]]() hand before I'm [[A]]() old,   
Show me what [[D]]() love is - haven't got a [[Bm]]() clue,    
Show me that [[G]]() wonders can be [[A]]() true,   
They say [[F#m]]() nothing last [[Bm]]() forever,   
We're [[Em]]() only here [[A]]() today,   
[[F#m]]() Love is now or [[Bm]]() never,   
[[Em]]() Bring me far [[A]]() away...   
   
Take me to your [[D]]() heart, take me [[Bm]]() to your soul,   
[[Em]]() Give me your hand and [[A]]() hold me,   
Show me what [[D]]() love is - be my [[Bm]]() guiding star,   
It's [[Em]]() easy - [[A]]() take me to your [[D]]() heart.   
   
[[D]]() Standing on a mountain high,   
Looking at the [[Bm]]() moon through a clear blue sky,   
[[G]]() I should go and see some friends,   
But [[A]]() they don't really comprehend...   
   
[[Bm]]() Don't need too much [[F#m]]() talking without [[G]]() saying [[A]]() any-[[D]]() thing.   
[[Bm]]() All I need is [[F#m]]() someone who [[Em]]() makes me wanna [[A]]() sing...
