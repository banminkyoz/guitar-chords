## Be your everything
> Boys like girls

**Capo: 1**

**Verse 1:**

[[Em7]]() Four letter word   
[[Cadd9]]() But I don't have the guts to say it   
[[Em7]]() Smile 'til it hurts   
[[Cadd9]]() Let's not make it complicated   
[[Em7]]() We've got a story   
[[Cadd9]]() But I'm about to change the ending   
[[Em7]]() You're perfect for me   
[[Cadd9]]() And I'm more than just a friend   
So we can just stop pretending [[D]]() now   
Gotta let you [[Cadd9]]() know somehow   

**Chorus:**

[[G]]() I'll be your [[D]]() shelter   
[[Cadd9]]() I'll be your storm   
[[G]]() I'll make you [[D]]() shiver   
[[Cadd9]]() I'll keep you warm   
[[G]]() Whatever [[D]]() weather   
[[Cadd9]]() Baby I'm yours   
[[Am7]]() Be your forever, be your fling   
[[Cadd9]]() Baby I will [[D]]() be your everything   
[[G]]() Baby I   
[[D]]() Baby I will   
[[Cadd9]]() Baby I will [[D]]() be your everything   

**Verse 2:**

[[Em7]]() We used to say   
[[Cadd9]]() That we would always stick together   
[[Em7]]() But who's to say   
[[Cadd9]]() That we could never last forever   
[[Em7]]() Girl, got a question   
[[Cadd9]]() Could you see yourself with somebody else?   
[[Em7]]()'Cause I'm on a mission   
[[Cadd9]]() And I don't wanna share   
I want you all to myself right [[D]]() now   
I just wanna [[Cadd9]]() scream it out
